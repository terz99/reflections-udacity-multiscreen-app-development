What is a ListView? What is an ArrayAdapter? How do they help you list all the items you need?

	- ListView is a view group which shows a list of a items using an ArrayAdapter. ArrayAdapter provides resources
	IDs from TextViews (by default). It recycles old not usable TextViews and uses them again to display new items. 

When to create a custom class?

	- We create custom class when we need to combine more than one Objects given from Java.

What is View Recycling?

	- View recycling is reusing already used Views. By using ArrayAdapter we can put already used Views into
	a scrap bunch which are called scrap Views. Those scrap Views are then used again when another item 
	should be displayed. With this, when listing a lot of items, the memory usage is smaller.
