What are intents? How many types are there? What is the difference between them?

	- Intents are some kind of initiators which can initate/start a new activity in the app. There are two types of 
	intents: implicit and explicit. Implicit intents are used when the app should call or start an activity which can 
	be handled by a different app. Explicit intents are used when the the app calls or starts an activiry within the 
	same app.

What are input events and event listeners?

	- Input events are measured by the user. In other words, the user chooses the input event the wants to trigger 
	(click, drag, long 	click...). Event listeners are components which are built in the Android SDK and they allow 
	us to control what happens in a specific event.
