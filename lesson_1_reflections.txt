What are intents? How many types are there? What is the difference between them?

	- Intents are some kind of initiators which can initate/start a new activity in the app. There are two types of 
	intents: implicit and explicit. Implicit intents are used when the app should call or start an activity which can 
	be handled by a different app. Explicit intents are used when the the app calls or starts an activiry within the 
	same app.

What are input events and event listeners?

	- Input events are measured by the user. In other words, the user chooses the input event the wants to trigger 
	(click, drag, long 	click...). Event listeners are components which are built in the Android SDK and they allow 
	us to control what happens in a specific event.

What is interface? What is abstract method and abstract class? What is concrete class?

	- Concrete class is a class which already has default values for every instance and default algorithms for every
	method. Abstract class cannot be instansiated since there must be at least one method which is not implemented.
	Abstract method is non-implemented method. This has been put this so that the developer can implement that 
	method himself. Interface is a collection of abstract methods. The interface can be implemented by a class
	and therefore that class will inherit all the abstract methods which the interface possess.
